# Core

The core functionality is provided by the `@paprize/core` package. The recommended way to use this library is through the wrapper libraries, unless you intend to use the pagination engine and report builder in a different manner.

Most of the functionality in `@paprize/core` is not documented, as it is not meant to be used directly. However, the shared types are provided here for reference.
