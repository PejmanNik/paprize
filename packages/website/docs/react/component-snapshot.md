# Component Snapshot

The pagination engine operates on cloned DOM elements generated by rendering [PageContent](/react/components.md#pagecontent) with React.
As a result, the React components are replaced by a static snapshot of their rendered output.
This means that any JavaScript logic, state, or interactivity within the children of the [PageContent](/react/components.md#pagecontent)
component is lost after the pagination operation.

You can suspend pagination for a section by using [Layout Suspension](/react/section-suspension.md), which postpones the snapshot creation process.
