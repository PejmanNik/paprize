# Components

All report components can be imported into your project from `@paprize/react`;

## Report Root

This component must be used as the parent component for the report, and all other components must appear as its children. It acts as the internal state provider for the report system.

```
<ReportRoot>...</ReportRoot>
```

<ComponentCatalog.Container isMandatory />

## Report Components

The fundamental building block of every report is the [**Section**](/components/report-components.md#section). Other [ReportComponents](/components/report-components.md) can be added to each section to form the complete report.  
The available components include:

<PageComponents />

### Component Snapshot

The pagination engine operates on cloned DOM elements generated by rendering [PageContent](/components/report-components.md#section) with React.

As a result, the [PageContent](/components/report-components.md#page-content) React component is replaced by a static snapshot of its rendered output. This means that any JavaScript logic, state, or interactivity within the children of the [PageContent](/components/report-components.md#page-content) component is lost after the pagination process.
