# Components

All components can be imported into your project from `@paprize/react`; This page lists all the components required to create a report.

Paprize components **must** be placed in specific positions within the component tree.
Using them outside of their expected structure will cause runtime errors.
Each component’s documentation explicitly specifies its valid parent and child components.
Paprize relies on this structure to correctly build the report.

When a component does not support dynamic height, **avoid** placing content inside it that could change its height between renders.
Dynamic height content can break the layout logic and cause pagination issues.

Any element whose height can vary between renders is considered dynamic height content.
For example, rendering a random quote that may contain 10–100 words could add or remove lines of text, causing the component’s height to change unexpectedly.

To prevent this, consider assigning a fixed height to such elements, reserving space for their content ahead of time.

## Report Root

This component must be used as the parent component for the report, and all other components must appear as its children. It acts as the internal state provider for the report system.

```
<ReportRoot>...</ReportRoot>
```

<ComponentCatalog.Container isMandatory />

## Section

A report is divided into sections, and each section defines its own page formatting, including page numbers, headers, footers, orientation, size, and plugins.

Every report must contain at least one Section, and each Section must contain one [PageContent](#pagecontent)
.

```jsx
<Section
    margin={pageMargin.Narrow}
    dimension={pageSize.A4}
    orientation={'landscape'}
    config={globalConfig}
>
    ...
</Section>
```

<ComponentCatalog.Container isMandatory>
<ComponentCatalog.Parent>[ReportRoot](#report-root)</ComponentCatalog.Parent>
<ComponentCatalog.Children>
<PageComponents />
</ComponentCatalog.Children>
</ComponentCatalog.Container>

**pageMargin**: It will provide the Microsoft Word default margins  
**pageSize**: It will provide most of the ISO 216 (e.g. A4, B5) + North American Sizes pages sizes

| PageOrientation | 'portrait' \| 'landscape'                                    |                                            |

:::info

The string values in `PageMargin` and `PageDimension` must contain a number and an acceptable CSS unit, e.g. `300mm`

# Component Snapshot

The pagination engine operates on cloned DOM elements generated by rendering [PageContent](/react/components.md#pagecontent) with React.
As a result, the React components are replaced by a static snapshot of their rendered output.
This means that any JavaScript logic, state, or interactivity within the children of the [PageContent](/react/components.md#pagecontent)
component is lost after the pagination operation.
