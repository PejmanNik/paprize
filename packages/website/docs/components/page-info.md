# Page Info

Pagination information — including total pages, current page, section info — is provided through several mechanisms, as the data becomes available at different stages of the pagination lifecycle.  
This part is framework-dependent, in React, the information is exposed through hooks, while in the Vanilla package it is provided via JavaScript events.

- [Page Info in React](/react/page-info.md)
- [Page Info in Vanilla](/vanilla/page-info.md)
- Limited [Page Info in Zero](/vanilla/page-info.md#attribute-based)
