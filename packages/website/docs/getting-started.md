# Getting Started

Paprize <sub>(Paper + Size)</sub> is framework agnostic report generation tool, Design your report using the full power of JavaScript and CSS, mark the report section by Paprize components and then Paprize pagination engine will transforming it into a beautiful, professional, print-ready pages.

Paprize support two mode for creating reports. Back-end and Front-end report generation. Each on come with a own benefit and limitation. You can read about each version in [Report Generation](/report-generation.md).

The core functionality is provided by the `@paprize/core` package. This package is low level, and several wrapper libraries are available to make it faster and easier to use.

- **[Paprize React](/react/quick-start.md) :** The richest and most feature-complete.
- **[Paprize Vanilla](/vanilla/quick-start.md) :** A pure TypeScript wrapper. Suitable for simple reports when you donâ€™t want to add React to your project.

In principle, everything available in the React library could also be implemented in the Vanilla one, the only limitation is the lack of use cases driving that implementation.
